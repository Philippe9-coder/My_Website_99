# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)



# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
skim(drinks)


```


Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
  head(25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y= reorder(country,beer_servings),
             x=beer_servings,
                  fill= country))+
  geom_col()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
  head(25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y= reorder(country,wine_servings),
             x=wine_servings,
                  fill= country))+
  geom_col()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")



```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% 
  head(25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y= reorder(country,spirit_servings),
             x=spirit_servings,
                  fill= country))+
  geom_col()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


```
